@0    = ~We need your help, Cromwell. Do you know of a place in the Troll Mountains that has something to do with smithing?~
@1    = ~Nope, never heard of a place like that.~
@2    = ~Or maybe... wait! I just remembered something. They say, that some mage went up there a few hundred years ago. Ansitus or Anstitus or something. Pah! Said, he wanted to uncover the secrets of metals!~
@3    = ~Needles to say, metalworking has nothing to do with magic. It is more about... but I doubt you are interested in this. I'll mark the location of the tower on your map. Just be careful.~
